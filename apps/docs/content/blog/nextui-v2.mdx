## What's New in Version 2?

<Spacer y={4} />

### Transition from Stitches to TailwindCSS

We've transitioned from [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) to [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
eliminating runtime styles and bringing you a more flexible and customizable UI library. This change allows
you to use NextUI v2 with the latest versions of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) without running
into React Server Components issues.

### TailwindCSS Plugin

NextUI v2.0 comes with a TailwindCSS plugin that enables the customization and addition of default themes.
This plugin allows you to customize colors and layouts tokens that are used by NextUI components.

```js {8,13-14}
// tailwind.config.js
const {nextui} = require("@nextui-org/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    "./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [nextui()],
};
```

> Go to [Themes](/docs/customization/theme) documentation to learn more about the plugin and how to use it.

### React Server Components Support

Thanks to the switch to TailwindCSS, **NextUI v2.0** now supports React Server Components by default. This
improves performance and allows you to use it with the latest versions of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

NextUI components already inclue the `use client;` directive so you can import them
server components.

```jsx
// app/page.tsx
import {Button} from "@nextui-org/button";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom Themes, Layouts and Colors

The `nextui` TailwindCSS plugin allows you to customize the default themes, layouts and colors tokens. It
also allows you to add new themes and customize them.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    nextui({
      themes: {
        light: {
          layout: {}, // light theme layout tokens
          colors: {}, // light theme colors
        },
        dark: {
          layout: {}, // dark theme layout tokens
          colors: {}, // dark theme colors
        },
        custom: {
          layout: {
            // custom theme layout tokens
            extend: "light" / "dark", // extend from light or dark theme
          },
          colors: {}, // custom theme colors
        },
        // ... custom themes
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

> Check out the [Layout](/docs/customization/layout) and [Colors](/docs/customization/colors) documentation
> for better understanding of the layout and colors tokens.

### Enhanced Documentation

We've built our new documentation on top of Next.js 13 using the App directory, making it simpler, more
robust, and more helpful than ever before. Additionally, we've improved the structure by placing useful
links at the top of each component documentation, such as the component storybook, npm, react-aria hooks, and links to
the source code and styles source code.

### New Templates and Guides

Two Next.js templates for App and Pages directories, alongside Vite, Remix, and Astro
installation guides, are introduced to aid your app creation process.

#### Next.js Templates

<NextJsTemplates />

#### Frameworks

<Frameworks />

### Custom Variants

We've added a new function, `extendVariants`, that allows you to customize any NextUI components's variants.

<VideoInView
  src="https://nextui-public-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-variants.mp4"
  width={700}
  height={350}
/>

You can create or override the component `variants`, `defaultVariants` and `componentVariants`.

> Check out the [Custom Variants](/docs/customization/variants) documentation for more information.

### Enhanced Styling Model

With the new slots model, you can style every part of your components effortlessly.

  height={350}
/>

> Check out the [Override Styles](/docs/customization/override-styles) documentation for more information.

### Tailwind Variants

Our new library, [Tailwind Variants](https://tailwind-variants.org), allows you to write TailwindCSS for large components in a reusable
and clear way. It automatically handles TailwindCSS class conflicts and all NextUI components are built on top of it.

> Check out the [Tailwind Variants](https://tailwind-variants.org) documentation for more information.

### Revamped Components

All components are written from scratch and integrated with [react-aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) hooks, ensuring enhanced performance
and better accessibility.

### Optimized Animations

Thanks to [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), we've significantly improved and optimized animations to make your
app feel more fluid and smooth.

### Individual Packages Support

Install only what you need, reducing CSS bundle as it will only include styles for the components
you're actually using.

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm i @nextui-org/button",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/button",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/button",
  }}
/>

> Check out the [Individual Packages](/docs/guide/installation#individual-installation) documentation for more information.

### Dark Mode Support

Implementing dark mode has never been easier. Thanks to the `nextui` TailwindCSS plugin, you can now use the `dark` theme
by just adding the `dark` class to the `body` / `html` or `main` tag.

```jsx {11}
// main.tsx or main.jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";
import App from "./App";
import "./index.css";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <NextUIProvider>
      <main className="dark text-foreground bg-background">
        <App />
      </main>
    </NextUIProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

<VideoInView
  src="https://nextui-public-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/dark-mode.mp4"
  width={700}
  height={350}
/>

> **Note**: **text-foreground** and **bg-background** changes the text and background colors to the current theme.

### New Components

We've added 6 new components, expanding the possibilities of what you can create.

- [Chip](/docs/components/chip): Small block of essential information that represent an input, attribute, or action.
- [Divider](/docs/components/divider): A line that separates content in a page.
- [Kbd](/docs/components/kbd): Displays which `key` or combination of keys performs a given action.
- [Skeleton](/docs/components/skeleton): Placeholder for loading content.
- [Snippet](/docs/components/snippet): Displays a code snippet.
- [Tabs](/docs/components/tabs): Organize content into separate views where only one view is visible at a time.

## Figma Community File

We're excited to also announce our **Figma Community File**. This file will enable you to easily translate
your designs into NextUI components. Whether you're a solo developer or working with a design team, our Figma
file helps streamline the process of transforming design ideas into functioning UI components.
