## Installation

<PackageManagers
  showGlobalInstallWarning
  commands={{
    cli: "npx nextui-cli@latest add card",
    npm: "npm install @nextui-org/card",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/card",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/card",

## Import

NextUI exports 4 card-related components:

- **Card**: The main component to display a card.
- **CardHeader**: Commonly used for the title of a card.
- **CardBody**: The content of the card.
- **CardFooter**: Commonly used for actions.

<ImportTabs
  commands={{
    main: 'import {Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter} from "@nextui-org/react";',
    individual: 'import {Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter} from "@nextui-org/card";',
  }}
/>

## Usage

<CodeDemo isPreviewCentered title="Usage" files={cardContent.usage} />

### With Divider

<CodeDemo isPreviewCentered title="With Divider" files={cardContent.divider} />

> See the [Divider](/docs/components/divider) component for more details.

### With Image

<CodeDemo isPreviewCentered title="With Image" files={cardContent.image} />

### Blurred Footer

You can pass the `isFooterBlurred` prop to the card to blur the footer.

<CodeDemo isPreviewCentered title="Blurred Footer" files={cardContent.blurredFooter} />

### Composition

You can use other NextUI components inside the card to compose a more complex card.

<CodeDemo isPreviewCentered title="Composition" files={cardContent.composition} />

### Blurred Card

You can pass the `isBlurred` prop to the card to blur the card. Card gets blurred properties based on its ancestor element.

> **Note**: To achieve the blur effect as seen in the preview, you need to provide a suitable background (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-tr from-[#FFB457] to-[#FF705B]`) to an ancestor element of the Card component allowing the Card's blur effect to be visible.

<CodeDemo isGradientBox title="Blurred Card" files={cardContent.blurred} />

### Primary Action

If you pass the `isPressable` prop to the card, it will be rendered as a button.

<CodeDemo title="Primary Action" files={cardContent.primaryAction} />

> **Note**: that the used callback function is `onPress` instead of `onClick`. Please see the [usePress](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/usePress.html#usepress) component for more details.

### Cover Image

You can use `Image` component as the cover of the card by taking it out of the `CardBody` component.

<CodeDemo title="Cover Image" files={cardContent.coverImage} />
