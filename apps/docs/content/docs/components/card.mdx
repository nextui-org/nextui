# Card

Card is a container for text, photos, and actions in the context of a single subject.

<ComponentLinks component="card" />

---

## Import

NextUI exports 4 card-related components:

- **Card**: The main component to display a card.
- **CardHeader**: Commonly used for the title of a card.
- **CardBody**: The content of the card.
- **CardFooter**: Commonly used for actions.

```jsx
import {Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter} from "@nextui-org/react";
```

## Usage

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={cardContent.usage} />

### With Divider

<CodeDemo title="With Divider" files={cardContent.divider} />

> See the [Divider](/docs/components/divider) component for more details.

### With Image

<CodeDemo title="With Image" files={cardContent.image} />

### Blurred Footer

You can pass the `isFooterBlurred` prop to the card to blur the footer.

<CodeDemo title="Blurred Footer" files={cardContent.blurredFooter} />

### Composition

You can use other NextUI components inside the card to compose a more complex card.

<CodeDemo title="Composition" files={cardContent.composition} />

### Blurred Card

You can pass the `isBlurred` prop to the card to blur the card.

<CodeDemo title="Blurred Card" files={cardContent.blurred} />

### Primary Action

If you pass the `isPressable` prop to the card, it will be rendered as a button.

<CodeDemo title="Primary Action" files={cardContent.primaryAction} />

> **Note**: that the used callback function is `onPress` instead of `onClick`. Please see the [usePress](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/usePress.html#usepress) component for more details.

### Cover Image

You can use `Image` component as the cover of the card by taking it out of the `CardBody` component.
