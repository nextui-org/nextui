<PackageManagers
  showGlobalInstallWarning
  commands={{
    cli: "npx heroui-cli@latest add drawer",
    npm: "npm install @heroui/drawer",

## Import

HeroUI exports 5 drawer-related components:

- **Drawer**: The main component to display a drawer.
- **DrawerContent**: The wrapper of the other drawer components.
- **DrawerHeader**: The header of the drawer.
- **DrawerBody**: The body of the drawer.
- **DrawerFooter**: The footer of the drawer.

<ImportTabs
  commands={{
    main: `import {
    Drawer,
    DrawerContent,
    DrawerHeader,
    DrawerBody,
    DrawerFooter
} from "@heroui/react";`,
    individual:
      `import {
    Drawer,
    DrawerContent,
    DrawerHeader,
    DrawerBody,
    DrawerFooter
} from "@heroui/drawer";`,
  }}
/>

## Usage

When the drawer opens:

- Focus is bounded within the drawer and set to the first tabbable element.
- Content behind a drawer is inert, meaning that users cannot interact with it.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={drawerContent.usage} />

### Sizes

<CodeDemo title="Sizes" files={drawerContent.sizes} />

### Non-dismissible

By default, the drawer can be closed by clicking on the overlay or pressing the <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> key.
You can disable this behavior by setting the following properties:

- Set the `isDismissable` property to `false` to prevent the drawer from closing when clicking on the overlay.
- Set the `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` property to `true` to prevent the drawer from closing when pressing the Esc key.

<CodeDemo title="Non-dissmissible" files={drawerContent.nonDismissable} />

### Drawer placement

The drawer can be placed on any edge of the screen using the `placement` prop:
- `left` (default)
- `right`
- `top`
- `bottom`

<CodeDemo title="Placement" files={drawerContent.placement} />

### With Form

The `Drawer` handles the focus within the drawer content. It means that you can use the drawer with
form elements without any problem. The focus returns to the trigger when the drawer closes.

<CodeDemo title="With Form" files={drawerContent.form} />

> **Note**: You can add the `autoFocus` prop to the first `Input` component to focus it when the drawer opens.

### Backdrop

The `Drawer` component has a `backdrop` prop to show a backdrop behind the drawer. The backdrop can be
either `transparent`, `opaque` or `blur`. The default value is `opaque`.

<CodeDemo title="Backdrop" files={drawerContent.backdrop} />

### Custom Motion

Drawer offers a `motionProps` property to customize the `enter` / `exit` animation.

<CodeDemo title="Custom Motion" files={drawerContent.customMotion} />

## Slots

- **wrapper**: The wrapper slot of the drawer. It wraps the `base` and the `backdrop` slots.
- **base**: The main slot of the drawer content.
- **backdrop**: The backdrop slot, it is displayed behind the drawer.
- **header**: The header of the drawer, it is displayed at the top of the drawer.
- **body**: The body of the drawer, it is displayed in the middle of the drawer.
- **footer**: The footer of the drawer, it is displayed at the bottom of the drawer.
- **closeButton**: The close button of the drawer.

## Data Attributes

`Drawer` has the following attributes on the `base` element:

- **data-open**:
  When the drawer is open. Based on drawer state.
- **data-dismissable**:
  When the drawer is dismissable. Based on `isDismissable` prop.

## Accessibility

- Content outside the drawer is hidden from assistive technologies while it is open.
- The drawer optionally closes when interacting outside, or pressing the <Kbd>Esc</Kbd> key.
- Focus is moved into the drawer on mount, and restored to the trigger element on unmount.
- While open, focus is contained within the drawer, preventing the user from tabbing outside.
- Scrolling the page behind the drawer is prevented while it is open, including in mobile browsers.
