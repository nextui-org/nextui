Tables are used to display tabular data using rows and columns. They allow users to quickly scan, sort, compare, and take action on large amounts of data.
Table implementation is based on <a href="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">
@react-aria/table</a>

```jsx
import { Table } from '@nextui-org/react';
```
