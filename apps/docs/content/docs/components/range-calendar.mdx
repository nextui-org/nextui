# Range Calendar

A range calendar consists of a grouping element containing one or more date grids (e.g. months), and a previous and next button for navigating through time. Each calendar grid consists of cells containing button elements that can be pressed and navigated to using the arrow keys to select a date range. Once a start date is selected, the user can navigate to another date using the keyboard or by hovering over it, and clicking it or pressing the Enter key commits the selected date range.

## Installation

<PackageManagers
  showGlobalInstallWarning
  commands={{
    cli: "npx nextui-cli@latest add calendar",
    npm: "npm install @nextui-org/calendar",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/calendar",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/calendar",
    bun: "bun add @nextui-org/calendar",
  }}
/>

## Import

<ImportTabs
  commands={{
    main: 'import {RangeCalendar} from "@nextui-org/react";',
    individual: 'import {RangeCalendar} from "@nextui-org/calendar";',
  }}
/>

## Usage

A RangeCalendar has no selection by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided to the RangeCalendar using the `defaultValue` prop. Alternatively, a controlled value can be provided using the `value` prop.

Date values are provided using objects in the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/) package. This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars, time zones, and other localization concerns.

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={rangeCalendarContent.usage} />

### Disabled

The `isDisabled` boolean prop makes the Calendar disabled. Cells cannot be focused or selected.

<CodeDemo title="Disabled" files={rangeCalendarContent.disabled} />

### Read Only

The `isReadOnly` boolean prop makes the Calendar's value immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the Calendar remains focusable.

<CodeDemo title="Read Only" files={rangeCalendarContent.readonly} />

### Controlled

A Calendar has no selection by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided to the Calendar using the `defaultValue` prop. Alternatively, a controlled value can be provided using the value prop.

<CodeDemo title="Controlled" files={rangeCalendarContent.controlled} />

### Min Date Value

By default, Calendar allows selecting any date. The `minValue` can also be used to prevent the user from selecting dates outside a certain range.

This example only accepts dates after today.

<CodeDemo title="Min Date Value" files={rangeCalendarContent.minDateValue} />

### Max Date Value

By default, Calendar allows selecting any date. The `maxValue` can also be used to prevent the user from selecting dates outside a certain range.

This example only accepts dates before today.

<CodeDemo title="Max Date Value" files={rangeCalendarContent.maxDateValue} />

### Unavailable Dates

Calendar supports marking certain dates as unavailable. These dates remain focusable with the keyboard so that navigation is consistent, but cannot be selected by the user. In this example, they are displayed in red. The `isDateUnavailable` prop accepts a callback that is called to evaluate whether each visible date is unavailable.

<CodeDemo title="Unavailable Dates" files={rangeCalendarContent.unavailableDates} />

### Non-Contiguous Ranges

The `allowsNonContiguousRanges` prop enables a range to be selected even if there are unavailable dates in the middle. The value emitted in the onChange event will still be a single range with a start and end property, but unavailable dates will not be displayed as selected. It is up to applications to split the full selected range into multiple as needed for business logic.

This example prevents selecting weekends, but allows selecting ranges that span multiple weeks.

<CodeDemo title="Unavailable Dates" files={rangeCalendarContent.nonContiguousRanges} />

### Controlled Focused Value

Calendar tries to avoid allowing the user to select invalid dates in the first place. However, if according to application logic a selected date is invalid, the isInvalid prop can be set. This alerts assistive technology users that the selection is invalid, and can be used for styling purposes as well. In addition, the errorMessage slot may be used to help the user fix the issue.

By default, the selected date is focused when a Calendar first mounts. If no `value` or `defaultValue` prop is provided, then the current date is focused. However, Calendar supports controlling which date is focused using the `focusedValue` and `onFocusChange` props. This also determines which month is visible. The `defaultFocusedValue` prop allows setting the initial focused date when the Calendar first mounts, without controlling it.

<CodeDemo title="Controlled Focused Value" files={rangeCalendarContent.controlledFocusedValue} />

### Invalid Date

This example validates that the selected date is a weekday and not a weekend according to the current locale.

<CodeDemo title="Invalid Date" files={rangeCalendarContent.invalidDate} />

### International Calendars

Calendar supports selecting dates in many calendar systems used around the world, including Gregorian, Hebrew, Indian, Islamic, Buddhist, and more. Dates are automatically displayed in the appropriate calendar system for the user's locale. The calendar system can be overridden using the [Unicode calendar locale extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/calendar#adding_a_calendar_in_the_locale_string), passed to the `Provider` component.

<CodeDemo title="International Calendars" files={rangeCalendarContent.internationalCalendars} />

### Visible Months

By default, the Calendar displays a single month. The `visibleMonths` prop allows displaying up to 3 months at a time.

<CodeDemo title="Visible Months" files={rangeCalendarContent.visibleMonths} />

### Page Behaviour

By default, when pressing the next or previous buttons, pagination will advance by the `visibleMonths` value. This behavior can be changed to page by single months instead, by setting `pageBehavior` to `single`.

<CodeDemo title="Page Behaviour" files={rangeCalendarContent.pageBehaviour} />

### Presets

Here's the example to customize `topContent` and `bottomContent` to have some preset values.

## Data Attributes

`Calendar` has the following attributes on the `CalendarCell` element:

- **data-focused**:
  Whether the cell is focused.
- **data-hovered**:
  Whether the cell is currently hovered with a mouse.
- **data-pressed**:
  Whether the cell is currently being pressed.
- **data-unavailable**:
  Whether the cell is unavailable, according to the calendar's `isDateUnavailable` prop. Unavailable dates remain focusable, but cannot be selected by the user. They should be displayed with a visual affordance to indicate they are unavailable, such as a different color or a strikethrough.
- **data-disabled**:
  Whether the cell is disabled, according to the calendar's `minValue`, `maxValue`, and `isDisabled` props.
- **data-focus-visible**:
  Whether the cell is keyboard focused.
- **data-outside-visible-range**:
  Whether the cell is outside the visible range of the calendar.
- **data-outside-month**:
  Whether the cell is outside the current month.
- **data-selected**:
  Whether the cell is selected.
- **data-selected-start**:
  Whether the cell is the first date in a range selection.
- **data-selected-end**:
  Whether the cell is the last date in a range selection.
- **data-invalid**:
  Whether the cell is part of an invalid selection.
