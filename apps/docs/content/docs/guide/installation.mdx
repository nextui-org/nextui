# Installation

Requirements:

- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) or later
- [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) or later
- [Framer Motion 4](https://www.framer.com/motion/) or later

------

To use NextUI in your project, you need to follow the following steps:

<Steps>

### Install Packages

To install NextUI, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: 'npm i @nextui-org/react@dev-v2 framer-motion',
    yarn: 'yarn add @nextui-org/react@dev-v2 framer-motion',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @nextui-org/react@dev-v2 framer-motion',
  }}
/>

### Tailwind CSS Setup

NextUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official
[installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add 
the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:


```js {8,13-14}
// tailwind.config.js
const { nextui } = require("@nextui-org/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    './node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [nextui()]
}
```

### Provider Setup

It is essential to add the `NextUIProvider` at the `root` of your application.


```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `NextUIProvider` component
import {NextUIProvider} from '@nextui-org/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap NextUIProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <YourApplication />
    </NextUIProvider>
  )
}
```

### Setup pnpm (optional)

If you are using pnpm, you need to add the following code to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@nextui-org/theme*
```

After modfiying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.
